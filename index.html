               <h2>Early Introduction</h2>
               <p>My mother taught me to crochet when I was young. We were always learning some kind of craft or skill, but my mother particularly loved to crochet. As a kid, I managed to make several potholders and I started a scarf that only ended up being about twice the length of a potholder before I abandoned it out of frustration. I wouldn't become passionate about this hobby for a couple of decades, but the seed had been planted.</p>

               <h2>Reintroduction</h2>
               <p>When I was 27, I relearned to crochet using how-to books. I was scheduled to have surgery and would have several weeks of recovery where I had to keep my feet elevated. I made many, many hats and gave them away as Christmas gifts. My interest in crochet would wax and wane every few years over the twenty years. </p>

                     My friends and family feigned delight as they opened itchy, ill-fitting hats made by my hand while under the influence of pain killers and bordom.

               <h2>Current Projects</h2>
               <p id = 'testP' class = 'funParagraph'>During the pandemic, I once again picked up this familiar hobby with gusto. My daughter would send me photos of crocheted tops or accessories and ask me to reproduce them for her. </p>

                     The jack-o-lantern top was made by following a tutorial by <a href="https://youtu.be/zp_kzxKjVyg">Made By B Jax on YouTube.</a> The others were designed by me.

               <p>I also still make hats, but they tend to fit better and be less itchy these days.</p>
